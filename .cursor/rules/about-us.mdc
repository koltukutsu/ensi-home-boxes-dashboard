# About WatchDash by Solace

## ðŸ’¡ WatchDash Philosophy
At Solace, WatchDash operates as our centralized monitoring solution with decentralized control capabilities:

**Decentralized Monitoring**: We empower teams to monitor their own devices and systems while staying connected to a shared source of information.

**Strategic Visibility**: WatchDash extends into multiple system components â€” devices, entities, performance metrics â€” with agility and depth.

**Unified Intelligence**: WatchDash's role is not to control, but to connect â€” offering resources, insights, and long-term perspective that allow teams to respond faster and smarter.

WatchDash is not just a dashboard â€” it is a model for how technical monitoring can be structured: many systems, one view.
